In one terminal run:    
```bash
python code/metrics_collector.py
```     

In another terminal run:    
```bash
python code/metrics_emmiter.py
```    

or just:
```sh
docker-compose up
```    
then watch as collector collects metrics, ie:  
```sh
docker-compose logs -f metrics_collector
```    

The `metrics_emitter` container runs on a python2.7 container whereas     
the `metrics_collector` container runs on a python3.7 container    


##### Linux named pipe/FIFO:   
The linux pipe buffers are implemnted as circular buffers[1].    
A consequence of the circular buffer is that when it is full and a subsequent write is performed:      
  (a) then it starts overwriting the oldest data[2].         

The only difference between pipes and FIFOs is the manner in which they are created and opened.     
Once these tasks have been accomplished, I/O on pipes and FIFOs has exactly the same semantics[3].     

Since Linux 2.6.11, the pipe capacity is 16 pages(65,536bytes ie 65KB).       
The command:     
```sh
  cat /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size
  1048576 == 1MB
```
shows the value that acts as a ceiling on the default capacity of a new pipe[3]     
 



##### TODO:   
A. load test.    
B. unit tests     


##### NOTES:
- you cant make one write which is bigger than `PIPE_BUF`[3]     
on linux the size of `PIPE_BUF` is about `4096`    
ie this code is likely to fail    
```python
write_data = 'a'
write_data = write_data.encode() * 4098
os.write(pipe, write_data)
```
